# COMP3314: Machine Learning Assignment 2

## Random Forest Classifier

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following libraries:

- [Numpy](http://numpy.org)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/)

### Code

The relevant files are provided in the 3035345306_A2 directory. 

### Files Needed

The dataset, layer, models and utils directories are required to be in the same location as the A2.py script. 

### Run

The project can be run using the command

```
python A2.py
```

This will run the LeNet5 Classifier for 20 epochs to train on mini-batches, printing out the training and test error after each mini-batch and finally running on the training data to provide the error rate.
